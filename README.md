# Liang-Causality
 A repo for implementing causality matrix with the method of Liang's information flow.

* `causality_estimation.py` contains the implementation using `numpy`.    
* `Causality_est_torch.py` contains the implementation using `torch`, where the method can be accessed via a regular function interface or as a torch module that can be directly integrated in neural networks' design as a layer.
